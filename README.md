Let's do this using [Deck.js][djs] because it seems pretty sweet.


**Tools Used:**

- writelatex.com: real-time co-editing documents
- git/github: code and documents storage and versioning
- dropbox: references and static/large document transfer and storage
- google drive: coediting, versioning and storage for management documents and notes
